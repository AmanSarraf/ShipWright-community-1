# Previous Proposals

## Release Signoff Checklist

- [ ] Enhancement is `implementable`
- [ ] Design details are appropriately documented from clear requirements
- [ ] Test plan is defined
- [ ] Graduation criteria for dev preview, tech preview, GA
- [ ] User-facing documentation is created in [docs](/docs/)

## Summary

This is a summary of the merged proposals that pre-dated the SHIP process.
Full details of these proposals can be found in [shipwright-io/build/docs/proposals](https://github.com/shipwright-io/build/tree/main/docs/proposals).

## Motivation

As of May 24, 2021, the community repository will serve as the official record of all new Shipwright enhancement proposals.
Previously discussed and merged proposals will not be migrated here - they will remain in shipwright-io/build for posterity.
Proposals actively under discussion at this time will also remain in shipwright-io/build until the respective pull requests are merged or closed.

### Goals

* Document enhancement proposals approved prior to the SHIP process.
* Provide links back to prior proposals for reference.

### Non-Goals

* Convert the older enhancement proposals to SHIPs.
